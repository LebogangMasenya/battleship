# Battleship Game

Welcome to the Battleship Game! This is a fun and interactive game where players try to sink each other's ships. Below are the rules, how to connect to the WebSocket, and instructions for running the app.

## Game Rules
1. **Setup**: Each player has a grid where they place their ships. The grid is typically 10x10.
2. **Ships**: Players have a set of ships of different lengths. The common ships are:
   - Carrier (5 spaces)
   - Battleship (4 spaces)
   - Cruiser (3 spaces)
   - Submarine (3 spaces)
   - Destroyer (2 spaces)
3. **Gameplay**: Players take turns guessing the coordinates of the opponent's ships. If a guess hits a ship, the opponent must announce it. If it misses, the turn passes to the other player.
4. **Winning**: The first player to sink all of the opponent's ships wins the game!

## Connecting to the WebSocket
To connect to the WebSocket server, use the following code snippet in ```socket.js```:
```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://websocket-url');

socket.onopen = function() {
    console.log('Connected to the WebSocket server!');
};

socket.onmessage = function(event) {
    console.log('Message from server:', event.data);
};
```
Make sure to replace `'ws://websocket-url'` with the actual URL of your WebSocket server.

## Running the Game
To run the app, follow these steps:
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd battleship/battleship-project
   ```
2. Install the dependencies (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   bunx vite
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to play the game!

## Potential Future Improvements
- **Live Deployment**: Implement a live deployment feature to allow players to join games hosted on a server, enhancing the multiplayer experience.
- **Improved Single Player Mode**: Develop a more engaging single-player mode with AI opponents that adapt to player strategies.
- **Leaderboard**: Introduce a leaderboard system to track player scores and rankings, fostering competition among players.

Enjoy playing Battleship!
